Scheme 1 gives simple interest at the rate of 7% per annum, while scheme 2 gives compound interest at the rate of 10% per annum. If the interest earned from scheme 1 after 3 years is Rs. 3885 which is Rs. 2735 less than the interest earned by scheme 2 in the same time period, then find the value of (y – x).",

    "explanation": "Simple interest earned from scheme 1 = Rs. 3885. So, (x × 7 × 3)/100 = 3885. x = 18500. Compound interest earned from scheme 2 = 3885 + 2735 = Rs. 6620. So, y × {(1.1)³ – 1} = 6620. 0.331y = 6620. y = 20000. Therefore, (y – x) = 20000 – 18500 = Rs. 1500",
